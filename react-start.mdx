# Integrating Blokay with React Applications

Blokay is a CDN library that can be included in any web project, regardless of the technology stack. This guide will walk you through the steps to integrate Blokay into your React app.

## Step 1: Generate Keys and JSON Web Token

Before integrating Blokay, you need to:

- Generate a **_publicKey_** and **_privateKey_** through the Blokay dashboard.
- Use the **_privateKey_** to create a JSON Web Token (JWT).

The JWT should have the following format:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "id": "YOUR_APP_USER_ID",
    "name": "YOUR_APP_USER_NAME",
    "extra1": "YOUR_APP_OWN_DATA"
  }
}
```

Replace "YOUR_APP_USER_ID", "YOUR_APP_USER_NAME", and "YOUR_APP_OWN_DATA" with your specific user information.

## Step 2: Add the Blokay Initialization Script

To load Blokay, include its script and configure the component in your project. You can add this in your index.html file or directly in the main React component.

```html
<script src="https://static.blokay.com/bl/CDN-Blokay.js"></script>

<web-component resource="BlokayResource"></web-component>
```

## Step 3: Set Up Blokay in React

In your main React file (e.g., App.js), add the following code to initialize Blokay using your publicKey and jwt.

```js
import { useEffect } from "react";

function App() {
  useEffect(() => {
    const loadBlokay = async () => {
      const bl = new window.Blokay({
        publicKey: "BLOKAY_PUBLIC_KEY",
        jwt: "YOUR_JSON_WEB_TOKEN",
      });
      bl.load();
    };

    loadBlokay();
  }, []);

  return (
    <div className="App">
      <h1>Blokay Integration in React</h1>
      {/* Your content here */}
      <web-component resource="BlokayResource"></web-component>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

Important: Replace "YOUR_JSON_WEB_TOKEN" with the JWT created in Step 1.

## Step 4: Verify Integration

Start your application to ensure Blokay loads correctly. You should see the component functional in your app.

```bash
npm start
```

Congratulations! Your React application is now integrated with Blokay.
