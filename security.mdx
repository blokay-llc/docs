# The Security of Your Data

At our company, the security of our customers' data is our top concern. We want you to feel secure entrusting us with your information, which is why we have implemented robust practices to ensure the protection of your sensitive data.

## Total Transparency

We are transparent in everything we do. We use open-source technologies in all our operations, meaning our code is available for anyone to review. We believe in total transparency because we want you to know exactly how we protect your data.

## High-Security Encryption

When it comes to protecting your data, we do not compromise on security. We use AES-256 encryption, a standard recognized for its robustness and reliability. This means your data is protected both at rest and in transit. You can rest assured that only you, with the appropriate encryption keys, can access your information.

## Minimal Storage and Transmission of Sensitive Data

We commit to storing only the information we truly need and retaining it only for the necessary duration. Additionally, we strictly limit the transmission of sensitive data to when it is absolutely necessary. This reduces any potential risks and ensures that your data is protected at all times.

## Additional Flexibility: On-Premise Installation

We understand that every company has its own unique needs and requirements. Thatâ€™s why we offer the option to install our software on-premise if you prefer. This gives you greater control over your data and allows you to integrate our solution more seamlessly within your existing infrastructure.

In summary, at our company, the security of your data is our number one priority. With transparent practices, high-security encryption, and a focus on minimizing the storage and transmission of sensitive data, you can trust us to protect your confidential information.
